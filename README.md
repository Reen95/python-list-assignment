## Overview
This project is a Python exercise demonstrating basic list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing elements, sorting, and finding an index.

## Instructions Completed
1. Created an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appended the values `10, 20, 30, 40`.
3. Inserted `15` at the second position.
4. Extended the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removed the last element from the list.
6. Sorted the list in ascending order.
7. Found and printed the index of the value `30`.

## Final Output
```text
Index of 30: 4
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
